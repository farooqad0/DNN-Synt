High-Frequency-Synthetic-Volume-DNN

Firstly, the syntethic is created through well logs. 
Secondly, the continuous wavelet transformation is performed on the seismic trace extracted from the well location
Thirdly, the Deep Neural Network is trained on the CWT data along with synthetic in order to generate the high frequency seismic data
